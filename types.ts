// The main benfit of typescript is that it enables you to add static types to js,
// types place contraints to program entities like functions, vars, and props so compilers
// and dev tools can offer better verification.

let x: number; // Explicitly declares c as a number type.
let y = 1; // Implicitly delcares y as a number type.
let z; //* Declares z without initializing it
